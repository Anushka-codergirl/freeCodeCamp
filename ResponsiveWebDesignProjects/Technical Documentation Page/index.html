      <p>C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at AT&T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>
      <p> C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.</p>
      <p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.C++ is regarded as a middle-level language,as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</p>
      <p>C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:</p>
<li><i>Encapsulation</i></li>
<li><i>Data Hiding</i></li>
<li><i>Inheritance</i></li>
<li><i>Polymorphism</i></li>

    <header>Uses of C++</header>
    <article>
      <p>There are several reasons to use C++ :</p>

      <li>C++ is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers in essentially every application domain.</li>
      <li>In Adobe Systems All major applications are developed in C++ : Photoshop & ImageReady, Illustrator, Acrobat, InDesign, GoLive</li>
      <li>C++ is widely used for teaching and research because it is clean enough for successful teaching of basic concepts.</li>
      <li>Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has indirectly used C++ because the primary user interfaces of these systems are written in C++.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia & many more companies uses C++ language.</li>

    <header>C++ and C</header>
    <article>
    <p>C follows the procedural programming paradigm while C++ is a multi-paradigm language(procedural as well as object oriented).In case of C, importance is given to the steps or procedure of the program while C++ focuses on the data rather than the process.
Also, it is easier to implement/edit the code in case of C++ for the same reason.</p>
    <p>In case of C, the data is not secured while the data is secured(hidden) in C++.This difference is due to specific OOP features like Data Hiding which are not present in C.</p>
    <p>C is a low-level language while C++ is a middle-level language.
    C is regarded as a low-level language(difficult interpretation & less user friendly) while C++ has features of both low-level(concentration on whats going on in the machine hardware) & high-level languages(concentration on the program itself) & hence is regarded as a middle-level language.</p>
   <p> C uses the top-down approach while C++ uses the bottom-up approach.In case of C, the program is formulated step by step, each step is processed into detail while in C++, the base elements are first formulated which then are linked together to give rise to larger systems.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>
    <p>The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character.</p>
    <p>It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C++ is case-sensitive.</p>

      Variable Declaration
      <p>
       For example, <code>
        int x;
        float amount;
       </code> 
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example: <code> int x = 42;
        char code='a';
        float pie=3.14;

  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header>Variable scope</header>
    <article>
     <p> A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three places, where variables can be declared −</p>
    <li>Inside a function or a block which is called local variables</li>
    <li>In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.</li>
    <li>Outside of all functions which is called global variables.</li>
  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Global variables</header>
    <article>
     <p>Global variables are defined outside of all the functions, usually on top of the program. The global variables will hold their value throughout the life-time of your program.</p>
    <p>A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. Following is the example using global and local variables −</p>
    <code>
      // Global variable declaration:
      int g;
      int main () 
      {
        // Local variable declaration:
        int a, b;
       // actual initialization
        a = 10;
      b = 20;
     g = a + b;
        cout << g;
      return 0;
      }
    </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Local_variables">
      <header>Local variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>Variables that are declared inside a function or block are local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. Following is the example using local variables −</p>
        <code>
          int main()
          {
           // Local variable declaration:
          int a, b;
          int c;
          // actual initialization
          a = 10;
          b = 20;
          c = a + b;
          cout << c;
          return 0;
          }
        </code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <article>
<p>Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they are called literals.

Constants can be of any of the basic data types and can be divided into Integer Numerals, Floating-Point Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values.</p>

      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
<p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>

<p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>

<code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
function f() {};
const f = 5;
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
function f() {
  const g = 5;
  var g;
  //statements
}</code>

      <p>C++ offers the programmer a rich assortment of built-in as well as user defined data types. </p>
      <p>Following are basic C++ data types −</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boolean</li>
<li>Character</li>
  <li>Integer</li>
<li>Floating point</li>
  <li>Double floating point</li>
 <li>Valueless</li>

  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <article>
Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

<code>if (condition) {
  statement_1;
} else {
  statement_2;
}</code>
condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
<p>
You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
<code>if (condition_1) {
  statement_1;
} else if (condition_2) {
  statement_2;
} else if (condition_n) {
  statement_n;
} else {
  statement_last;
} </code>
In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

<code>if (condition) {
  statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
  statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
} else {
  statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
  statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
}</code>
It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
<code>if (x = y) {
  /* statements here */
}</code>
If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

<code>if ((x = y)) {
  /* statements here */
}</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

<code>while (condition)
  statement</code>
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

<p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>

      <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>

Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

<code>int n = 0, x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}</code>
<p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>

<li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
<li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
<li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
 <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
    <header>Function declarations</header>
    <article> 
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

      <li>The name of the function.</li>
      <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
      <li>The C++ statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
      <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</P>

<code>function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}</code>
<p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
    </p>
    <code>return number * number;</code>
<p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
